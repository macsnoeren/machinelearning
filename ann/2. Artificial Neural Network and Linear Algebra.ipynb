    "An example of an artificial neural network is shown by the figure above. This neural network has two layers. The input layer does not count, while this layer connects the input to the neural network. This neural network contains an input layer with three inputs, a hidden layer with four nodes and a output layer with two nodes. Deep neural networks contain more hidden layers. With more hidden layers the problem to solve can be more complex. The hidden layer performs the actual pattern recognition."
